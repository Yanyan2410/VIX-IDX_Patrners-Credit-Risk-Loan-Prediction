# Project Background

Credit risk refers to the potential loss that arises when a borrower fails to repay a loan or fulfill their contractual obligations. When evaluating loan applications, credit companies must determine whether to accept or decline based on the applicant's profile. Currently, Lending Club has a 12.29% default rate from 2007-2016. To address this, we aim to increase the amount financed by Lending Club and decrease the number of accepted loans with bad repayment histories. Our approach involves analyzing historical credit application data to gain insights into borrower behavior and developing a predictive model to effectively mitigate credit default risks.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset contains 466,285 rows, each representing a unique loan application, and comprises 74 features. These features provide valuable information about the loan applicants, including their personal details, financial information, employment history, and more. The dataset is carefully curated to capture a comprehensive view of the borrowers and their creditworthiness.
